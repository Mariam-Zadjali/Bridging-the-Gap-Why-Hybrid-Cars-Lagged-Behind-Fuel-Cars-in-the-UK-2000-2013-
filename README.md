Understanding the Performance and Market Gap Between Hybrid and Fuel Cars in the UK (2000–2013)

## Introduction
The early 21st century marked a turning point in global discussions on climate change, environmental sustainability, and the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The transportation sector, as one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, became a central focus of policy initiatives aimed at promoting cleaner and more sustainable alternatives. Hybrid vehicles, which combine internal combustion engines with electric propulsion, were introduced as a transitional technology to bridge the gap between traditional fuel-powered cars and fully electric vehicles.  

## Problem Statement
Despite growing policy initiatives aimed at promoting cleaner transportation, fuel-powered cars consistently outnumbered hybrid vehicles by a factor of 44 between 2000 and 2013 in the UK.

## Aim
To identify the key barriers that limit the uptake of hybrid cars compared to conventional fuel cars and assess the implications on emission goals of the UK.

## Approach
1.	To compare cost differences between hybrid and fuel cars from 2000–2013.
2.	To examine consumer awareness and perceptions of hybrid technology during this period.
3.	To analyze the role of infrastructure availability (e.g., charging/fueling support) in shaping adoption.
4.	To assess how technological limitations (e.g., battery performance, reliability) impacted consumer choice.
5.	How did the fuel efficiency of hybrid cars compare to conventional fuel cars in the UK between 2000 and 2013?
6.	What differences exist in terms of engine performance (e.g., horsepower, acceleration, torque) between hybrids and fuel cars during this period?
7.	Did hybrids provide measurable cost savings in fuel consumption compared to conventional cars over their lifecycle?
8.	How did the maintenance and reliability performance of hybrid vehicles differ from that of fuel-powered vehicles?
9.	Were there trade-offs between performance (speed, power) and efficiency (fuel consumption, emissions) in hybrid cars compared to conventional models?
10.	To what extent did technological advancements in hybrid systems improve their performance relative to fuel cars between 2000 and 2013?
11.	How did consumer perceptions of performance (drivability, convenience, comfort) influence the preference for fuel cars over hybrids?
12.	To analyze how the dominance of fuel cars influenced the UK’s progress toward cleaner transportation goals.
